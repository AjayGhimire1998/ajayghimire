          <br />
          I always thought my dream was to be a software developer for an
          innovative software company, having my own cabin with multi-screen
          setup, sipping my dark roasted coffee and programming a next big tech.
          It was a pretty relevant dream, as I was studying bachelor's in
          software development. But things always do not go as planned. During
          my bachelor's, I came across a financial hardship & had to work extra
          jobs to support my tuition. That is when I started working as a
          kitchen hand in a super busy Japanese restaurant. My hard work,
          ability to get noticed and become a positive presence in the workplace
          and ability to learn quickly, identify and solve problems led me to
          get promoted as a cook in just six months.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was happy that my skills were building, but sad at the same time, as
          my academic performance was down the ladder. Just like they say
          'sometimes everything hits you all at once', Covid-19 came up & caused
          taking me four years to finally graduate with the undergraduate degree
          but with low performance that hiked my ambiguity. I was not ready for
          the industry. After the second major lockdown ended, Sydney went back
          to normalise life & I was back to my kitchen job too. But it didn't
          felt right to compromise my dream. I realised the only solution is to
          start learning more, learning something different everyday.

          And that's when I came across Academy Xi, a software engineering
          bootcamp which ignited the spark I was needing, to not give up on my
          dream and continue in the path to pursue it. I joined the program and
          coded 60 hours a week with 5 days a week of mentorship for almost 7
          months along side working 2 days in the kitchen to support just enough
          my expenses. Since then, I can't get enough.
          <br />
          <br />
          First 4 months, I dived deep into the front-end development using
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I was in a streak, for developing 3
          different projects (backed up nicely in Git) which the mentor revered.
          I enjoyed the pace I was learning in. After building a Ruby CLI
          application, Ruby-on-Rails was a piece of cake with whatever flavour I
          could imagine eating it with, as it is one of the best versatile and
          top back-end framework supported by a large community of Ruby gems
          developers. After my final e-commerce project (also backed up nicely
          in my git), I achieved a certified Software Engineering Transform
          badge.

            dedicated team.</strong
